- **Lightweight**: bResponsivr comes packed with features, including styling for most elements, a grid, and some components, all in just **5kb**.
- **Beautiful**: The styles that come with Responsivr are clean and modern, dropping it into your project will give you a headstart in design.

## Installation

You can install Responsivr in multiple ways, but it's as simple as installing to your project using `npm`.

```
npm install responsivr --save
```

- Chrome latest
- Firefox latest
- Opera latest

The above list is non-exhaustive. Skeleton works perfectly with almost all older versions of the browsers above, though IE certainly has large degradation prior to IE9.
